## Description 
In this project I was tasked with creating an app that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing.

### Acceptance Criteria
Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

- The city name

- The date

- An icon representation of weather conditions

- The temperature

- The humidity

- The wind speed

When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

- The date

- An icon representation of weather conditions

- The temperature

- The humidity

When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

* I have added wind data to the forecast to keep the weather data consistent.
